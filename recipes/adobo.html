    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Pork Adobo recipe is taken from this website: <a href="https://panlasangpinoy.com/filipino-food-pork-adobo-recipe/" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pork belly</strong> - For a juicy, meaty dish!</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - Makes for the most savory stew.</li>
        <li><strong>Dried bay leaves</strong> - Gives off the perfect adobo aroma </li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar</strong> - Part of what makes adobo so brilliantly unique is its sourness, which we get from vinegar.</li>
        <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong> - There’s nothing quite like the salty quality of soy sauce!</li>
        <li><strong>Peppercorn</strong> - Just for the slightest bit of spice!</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong> - As this has a stew, we will definitely be using plenty of water!</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - And to make sure everything is nice and flavorful, you will be using some salt too.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the pork belly, soy sauce, and garlic then marinade for at least 1 hour</li>
