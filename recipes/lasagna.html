    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lasagna recipe is taken from this website: <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/lasagna-recipe/" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
    <p>
        This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, saucy, and packed with flavor in every bite. 
        Lasagna is a staple for busy school nights because it keeps, reheats, and freezes so well, and it’s nice to have something in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef - We'll use 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable. You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety.</li>
        <li>Aromatics - Yellow onion and fresh garlic add layers of flavor and aroma</li>
        <li>Red wine - This amps up the flavor of your sauce (do not use cooking wine). You can sub wine with beef broth or chicken broth.</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce - Use <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/marinara-sauce/" target="_blank">homemade marinara</a> or store-bought.</li>
        <li>Dried thyme - Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
        <li>Sugar - balances the acidity of the marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Parsley - flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles - Cook these al dente; they’ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes. You can also use no-boil noodles.</li>
        <li>3 Cheeses - I love combining shredded mozzarella, ricotta cheese and cottage cheese for a moist and gooey cheese sauce. The cottage cheese ensures it’s super juicy on the reheat.</li>
        <li>Egg - helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>How to Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the beef</li>
        <p>Add oil to a deep pan and sautee onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</p>
        <li>Simmer the sauce</li>
        <p>Pour in 1/4 cup of wine and stir until almost evaporated. Add marinara, salt, pepper, thyme, sugar, and parsley; bring to a simmer, then cover and cook the tomato sauce 5 minutes.</p>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to Make the Cheese Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the cheese filling</li>
        <p>Combine all the cheese sauce ingredients and 1 cup of mozzarella in a mixing bowl (reserve the rest of the mozzarella for later)</p>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to Make the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Noodles</li>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 375ºF and cook the lasagna noodles in a pot of well-salted water until barely al dente (firm to the bite – don’t overcook it), then drain and pour in cold water to stop the cooking process and prevent sticking.</p>
        <li>Assemble Lasagna</li>
        <p>Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/40511-890-Ceramics-Rectangular-13x9-inch-Turquoise/dp/B07633FM3L?crid=22AZJUC1ZPKHK&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.LOtP4Gg_RBnEIm4SKCULNg1xBIMVFmZCjllxs7BMl6r3kt0QN-0S4G-zy9Ri-6PoEM0sDHRfZJOsUHQL67Pcg-kaG0FPf6HKez7nxAXUumdSClTUMOBTfQxVh0RjOgd9abYsXXCv4Rfrr6tsASHrdH9nF55zcpOVhrvD5DivFhZYo0y7sD-HszvPva7izmQb_DmWoEaukDsHGGdBhtertzmqhoVZDt_0fQzzJuSZa_N_Cz2URp3_q5pvzm9zoLeF9iV8E6o249BlD_YT0mN1SjCNmdAZlAVnOgA-YBhEN2zK3xsFiK4_se1Wp-3hzuXiqfRdajaCavC5-ByPLx4W43TZigm_H0YNjyaN923C7b0.jN5ZP3KI6Ez0dd0VCNIjZs5fDOr0E81WhOerAhejX6c&dib_tag=se&keywords=staub%2B13x9&qid=1734559573&s=home-garden&sprefix=staub%2B13x9%2Cgarden%2C151&sr=1-1&th=1&linkCode=sl1&tag=blognkcom-20&linkId=b11f639fec3dd2ded93ca9a6c53157b4&language=en_US" target="_blank">9×13-inch casserole dish</a>. Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella.</p>
        <li>Bake</li>
        <p>Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes, then remove the foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the cheese is lightly browned. Important! Let the lasagna rest for about 30 minutes before cutting and serving. If you cut into it right away, it will slide apart.</p>
